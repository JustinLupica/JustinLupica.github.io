For my Rails project, I decieded to make an application further diving into the concept that I explored in my Sinatra application. I built a Order Tracker App, designed for internal business usage. Employess can log on to the application, they can create new customers to be stored in the database, and they can create new orders that are associated with that customer, as well as the many products that can be, and have been, ordered by the customers. 

This app was a ton of fun to make, I especially enjoyed seeing everything come together and felt a huge rush of joy when a feature I've been working on finally works as I was wanting it to. As exciting as that was, I also enjoyed the styling, although I used bootstrap to speed the process up, it was still fun seeing it come to life. 

My app includes associations between customers, the orders that the customers have placed, as well as the products that the customers have ordered. This would give great insight into business analytics such as, what products do certain customers like? How many orders does this customer have? What is the average order size for a specific customer?

In the future, I would like to add more features to make this more business-friendly, with features like, a price for each product, an admin dashboard where the admin can see how many products, have been sold that day, how many new customers vs return customer sales for the day or week, graphs for sales amounts, etc.

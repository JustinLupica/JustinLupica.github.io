This Sinatra project was a challenging one, mostly because I wanted to add so many features and designs into it. I ended up getting the CSS and overall design looking good, and the functionality requirements work good through the testing as well. I'm a little dissatisfied with it though, because I feel like there were much more features I wanted to implement, just didn't have time and kept running into errors. 

I wanted to be able to add this project into my portfolio, and I feel as if I have partially accomplished that. I think it looks well enough to be included, but the functinoality defintely could be improved in the future. 

I learned a lot doing this project, and it has further increased my love of creating useful applications to help make lives easier and more efficient!

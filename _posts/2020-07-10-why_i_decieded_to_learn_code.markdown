I grew up in my parent's business. Always trying to learn, trying to work harder, and faster. Anything so I could help out the business and provide value. When I got old enough to study how things were being run, I couldn't help but to think, "There's got to be an easier way of doing this..", and so my 15 year old brain went to work researching a better way to create more flow within the production of the company. It was currently being run by spreadsheets and pencil and paper, but that was old-school, tedious, and you ended up living in a mountain of paperwork. I thought, "it's all just numbers and mathematical operations, who could do that faster than a computer?"

With that realization, I. got to work at my local library, checking out all the C++ books I could find. I got to reading, only to realize a few weeks later, that it was super complicated and frustrating to learn.. much less build an entire program to run a company with. Needless to say, I was an ambitious kid! Eventually though,  I got tired and frustrated.. 

I later started an engineering class in high school, and was exposed to the world of CAD. I looked up the program at home to try to get it on my computer, but as a broke high school kid, I couldn't afford any liscences. So i kept searching, and eventually came across an open sorced, 3d modeling program called Blender. I was intrigued. I downloaded it and spent the next few years learing how to 3d model, animate, texture, everything needed to make my own artwork. I eventually needed to expand my skillset and felt the buring urge to create something that people could use, interact with, and derive value from. I couldn't fulfill that through 3d animation, so I turned my sights on website development. Once I got turned on to that, it was game over for me. I had finally found what could scratch that itch for me, that creating artwork just couldn't reach. 

So back to work i went, looking up countless tutorials on YouTube, Lynda, blogs, anywhere I could find any useful information about the process. Eventually I came across a channel on YouTube that talked about Code Bootcamps, and how you could become a developer and earn a desirable living by going through one of those. The most recommended ones were Lamda and Flatiron. I researched both and decieded to try for Flatiron. 

This brings me to the present, putting my all into learning coding to become a softward developer! It is both a nerve-wracking but exciting time for me! I can't wait to start building advanced full stack programs and applications!

For my last project here at Flatiron ("EEEKKKK") I decieded I would try to build an application I've had my eyes set on since the Sinatra project! 

Every single week, my wife and I have to sit down and decide what meals we are going to have for the week. Between us trying to eat healthy and the kids only wanting to eat chicken nuggets, well its been a challenge to say the least! With myself being a Chef before I switched to coding, I am always trying to bring in new recipes I know of, and I get bored of the same 4 to 5 meals that we normally cycle through every week. We always scour the web for new recipe ideas, but between all the ads these guys cram into their webpages, you can barely even see the recipes much less the ingredients and instructions..

I've had the idea to make a recipe application for a while now, one that will let the user discover new recipes by searching for a specific dish type, or maybe even just a cuisine type they are in the mood for. I wanted the user to be able to view the recipe instructions and ingredients, and be able to persist the recipes they like to come back to later.

So that's what I built!

It was a very very challenging but exciting project, and boy has it been a busy past couple of weeks. I found Redux to be a bit more trouble than it's worth but I can defintely see how it could be useful for bigger and more dynamic applications, therefore making Redux a valuable tool to learn! All in all, this project really pushed me and I'm looking forward to working more with React in the future! (I think it's my favorite framework so far!)

This Application lets you keep track of any and all books that you have surrently sitting on your bookshelf!

If you are anything like me, you probably have more books than you know what to do with..

I can't hardly keep track of them all!

So I created this handy application that will let you manually enter in the Title, Author, and ISBN (International Standard Book Number; or ID for short!)

This way you will be able to keep track of all the books you have... somewhere around here...

I have also added a pretty cool feature that allows you to search for a book topic that interests you, and recieve back related books from the Google Book API!

There is also a "Read Book" button that will allow you to preview the book in a viewer page (if that books allows for a preview viewing)


This project was ton of fun to work on! It showed the dynamic capability and usability of just plain ole vanilla javascript! It really gave me a chance to learn a lot, and I was able to solve a problem that I was having myself and I loved being able to add more functionality to the app with the more ideas I had. 

It was a challenge to make it all single page, but I guess that was the point because it really challenged my DOM manipulation skills and pushed me further to learn more about it and create a rich SPA!

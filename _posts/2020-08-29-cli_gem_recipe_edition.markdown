I ended up being pretty proud of this project and how it came together in the end. After grinding lesson after lesson for the past 2 months, this project reminded me of why I fell in love with coding in the first place! The world opens up when you know how to code. I have ideas all the time for ways to either improve or automate everyday tasks, and this is helping me get one step closer to being able to execute on my ideas.

Whenever my wife and I are going grocery shopping, we like to plan out what we want our meals for that week to be, so we can buy groceries accordingly. One tool I always wished I had was something to be able to select a type of food from a list, and then be presented with a list of recipes/dishes that are related to that category. Then I would love for it to be able to display information such as: shopping list of ingredients needed, step by step instructions on how to make the dish, and maybe a description, so if I'm not sure on what a recipe is, it can tell me!

I thought this project would be a great place for me to start working on this idea! My CLI project is able to do most of those things, with the exception of presenting a shopping list of ingredients, and step by step instructions. Instead, what it is able to do, is present the user with categories it recieved from an API, and then bring up a list of recipes based off what category the user selected! It then is able to go one step farther, and present a decription and a video url that points to a hosted video with step by step instructions to help the user out that way.

It is far from being perfect, I'm sure! But, I am sure I will be back in this code eventually to add some more features and fine tune a few of the ideas already in it! This has been a blast to work on and can't wait to get started on some more projects in the future!!

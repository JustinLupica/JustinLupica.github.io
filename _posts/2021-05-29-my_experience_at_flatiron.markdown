Now that my time at Flatiron school has come to a close, I thought I would take this opportunity and reflect back on my experience here at Flatiron!

I am a father of two wonderful young boys (age 7 and 4) and a husband! I also work full time (pre-covid) and so when I was looking into Flatiron School, I needed something that wouldn't take away too much time from my family and I could also do around my work schedule (after all, bills still need paid!). I did some research and found Flatiron had a great reputation and even a money back gaurantee if you weren't placed in a job within 6 months of graduation! They also had a part time, online version of the program that was 10 months long! So far I was loving everything I was seeing!

I put in an application to the school and signed up for the pre-work course, since I couldn't wait to start learning to code!

Needless to say, the pre-work was no joke! If I recall correctly, you have to complete around 80% of the pre-work which was unexpectedly very lengthy! It covered a lot of JavaScript and taught me a lot of the fundamentals of programming, like data collection methods (arrays, hashes, objects and how to use the languages built-in methods to manipulate them) which of course was crucial to the program! I could tell Flatiron was legit, and really put a lot of work and thought into what they were teaching and how they taught it!

The first mile, and the first language, Ruby, was the most stressful and hardest to grasp. Some concepts came easy, and some concepts made me want to quit! But as with everything in life, nothing comes easy and you have to persevere for what you really want! 


By the end of the 3rd project mode, Ruby on Rails, I really felt confident in my abilities as a developer, and while I knew I was nowhere near the level I wanted to be at, I felt like I could build out any project I could dream up!

One thing I really like about Flatiron, is that they don't tell you what projects to make for your portfolio. I have attended a school before (not coding related) and everyone had to make the same projects so hundreds of people ended up with the same portfolio coming out of the school. Talk about not standing out to a potential employer!

By the end of the program, I found out I really love working with JavaScript and React and I am so excited to continue learning and continue building projects!

I can also tell my kids and friends that I learned to code during COVID!

I honestly cannot wait to get started living the dream and creating projects everyday! The job search begins now!
